            Introduction
                <p>Welcome to Viva New Vegas, a fully modular vanilla-plus modding guide for Fallout New Vegas!</p>
        </h2>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            IMPORTANT: Everything in this guide is written down for a reason! It is vital to read <b>everything!</b>
            You can NOT skip any paragraphs/instructions and expect your game to function as it should.

            <p class="subparagraph">
                    Viva New Vegas is a modding guide for Fallout New Vegas that will carefully walk you through how to install all the mods you will need for a perfectly stable, smooth, and most importantly, enjoyable experience.
                    Unlike other modding guides, it is built with customization in mind. Mods are subjective, so every mod listed in the guide is 100% optional.
                    Custom patches and a hand-made load order and will be provided for the guide, and they will still work if you skipped any mods.
                    <br> <br>
                    The guide is highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience.
                    It still is incredibly important that you read <u>all</u> the instructions very carefully, even if you believe you are experienced enough to skip them.
                    There are many small instructions that are vital for your game to function, and could be easily missed if you aren't careful. Although you don't need any modding experience to use this guide,
                    it is expected for you to be relatively experienced with operating a computer in general.
            </p>
        <a class="internallink" href="#about"><h2 class="subheader" id="about">About the Guide</h2></a>
            <a class="internallink" href="#features"><p class="smallheader" id="features">Features:</p></a>
                <ul class="standard_ul">
                    <li>
                        <b>Stability:</b>
                            Don't let crashing be a core feature of the game anymore! The guide includes all essential stability enhancements and no placebo/dangerous mods.
                            With a complete install of the guide, you should have zero crashes! Of course there are no guarantees with New Vegas though.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Performance:</b>
                            Every tool, setting, and mod in the guide has been carefully selected and play-tested to ensure maximum possible performance.
                            No 4k texture mods, no ENBs, no poorly scripted mods, or any other unoptimized/broken mods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Better Gameplay:</b>
                            The guide includes many mods that greatly improve the gameplay, without drastically overhauling the core experience or straying away from the game's original intent.
                            There is also an optional <b>Overhauls</b> section that will make the game much more difficult and add some new vanilla-friendly content. This section is not recommended for first time players.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Custom Mods and Patches:</b>
                            When needed, the guide will provide custom mods, addendums to existing mods, or patches for mods to make them compatible and consistent with the guide.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Customizability:</b>
                            The guide is fully modular, every mod listed is 100% optional. Hand-made load order and patches will be provided, and they will work perfectly even if you left out any mods.

                    There may be less mods than you may be used to with a modded game, but there is good reason for that. Fallout New Vegas is an extremely fickle game, more so than Skyrim or Fallout 4.
                    Even seemingly harmless mods can cause major issues. Many of the most popular mods were made right after the game came out, and as modding has advanced a lot since then, they are
                    outdated and unsafe to use. One category I'm sure that a lot of people will be disappointed in is the Visuals. My opinion on visual mods is this: Fallout New Vegas is a ten year old game,
                    and it looked dated even by 2010 standards. You will never be able to make the game look "good". Any visual improvements you make to the game come at a cost. ENBs may make for pretty screenshots,
                    but they are near-impossible to play with due to the many bugs, performance problems, and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8UT356J" target="_blank">vision-obscuring effects</a> they use. Texture mods may improve some textures, but they can
                    cause performance drops and stuttering even on higher-end PCs. The limiting factor is the game's 32-bit engine rather than your PC. They also create a great disparity between the new textures and the vanilla textures, both in quality and in style,
                    making for some <a href="https://imgur.com/a/jMgRjBO" target="_blank">jarring texture transitions or seams</a>. Overall, I do not think that these types of mods are worth it.
                </p>
            <a class="internallink" href="#additional_mods"><p class="smallheader" id="additional_mods">Additional Mods:</p></a>
                <p class="subparagraph">
                    If you are looking to add more mods to your setup, please wait until <b>after</b> you have completed the guide, or else we will be unable to help you on <a href="https://discord.gg/DhX5S27" target="_blank">Discord</a> should you need it.
                    Unfortunately, I do not have the time or energy to provide support for setups that install extra mods on top of the guide.
                    If you do plan on adding mods after you finish the guide, please reference <a href="./avoid-mods.html" target="_blank">this</a> list of mods that you should avoid using.
                    I can not stress enough that is only recommend to add your own mods if you are an experienced modder and know how to manually
                    make conflict resolution patches and sort your load order! You can't just throw a bunch of mods on top of the guide without doing any conflict resolution
                    or use automated tools and except your game to function as intended! A reminder that I will <u>not</u> supported setups that have added any mods.

                <p class="subparagraph">
                    The guide will make the game run much better than vanilla. As the game is ten years old, you do not need a very strong PC to run it.
                    Installing the game on an SSD can drastically improve load times and decrease stuttering.
                    Here are the recommended specs for being able to run the guide at 60FPS in 1080p:
                    <br> <br>
                        <ul class="standard_ul">
                            <li><b>CPU:</b> Any dual-core processor (2.5GHz or more)</li>
                            <li><b>RAM:</b> 4GB of RAM (speed shouldn't effect much)</li>
                            <li><b>GPU:</b> NVIDIA 600 series card or an AMD 5500 series card</li>
